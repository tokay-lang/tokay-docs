# Installation

Currently, Tokay is in a very early project state. Therefore you have to built it from source, using the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language and its build-tool `cargo`.

Once you got Rust installed, install [Tokay](https://crates.io/crates/tokay) by

```bash
$ cargo install tokay
```

Once done, you should run the Tokay REPL with
```bash
$ tokay
Tokay 0.6.0
>>> print("Hello Tokay")
Hello Tokay
>>>
```

You can exit the Tokay REPL with `Ctrl+C`.

> The next examples are showing the REPL-prompt `>>>` with a given input and output. The output may differ when other input is provided.
